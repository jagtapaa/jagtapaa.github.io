As an Information Technology Intern at Camaco-Amvian, I have gained hands-on experience in various facets of IT support and administration. My primary responsibilities have included setting up laptops, monitors, and TVs, ensuring that all equipment is properly configured and operational for employee use. I have also managed and created user accounts for employees, facilitating smooth onboarding and access to necessary resources. Additionally, my role has required proficiency with Microsoft 365, where I have assisted in managing subscriptions, configuring email accounts, and supporting users with troubleshooting and optimizing their use of the suite's applications. This internship has provided me with a robust understanding of IT infrastructure and user support within a corporate environment.
