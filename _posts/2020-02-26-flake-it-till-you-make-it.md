From 2019 â€“ 2021 was a member of the Chassis / Drivetrain group and helped design and create the chassis of the robot while also assisting to CAD the chassis. From 2021- 2023 I was promoted to manage the Chassis team and create a very durable bumper which would surround an aluminum frame and integrate Swerve drivetrain. I lead the group in making 3D CAD Models on Autodesk Inventor, creating physical parts and assembling them to make the chassis. I also have experience in managing a team in creating technical writeups on Google Docs which will be used in presentations in front of the Judges.
